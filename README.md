 Requests. I used Semantic Ui React for the forms as you   Can see below .In this Project I learned  more about 
 React Hooks specifically the UseEFFect hook to make api Calls  in React and 
 React onlick Events I created a small navbar at the bottom of the form to navigate to each page 
 and delete and update buttons on the form to change the data on the API  and I used local storage to store all
 the data Locally in the browser.
